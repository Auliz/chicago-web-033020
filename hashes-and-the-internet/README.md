# Hashes and the Internet

1) Find where the info lives on the internet and how to get it (READ DOCS)
2) Use Ruby to access the internet info
3) Convert internet info into a Ruby Hash
4) Get the data we actually want from the hash!

### Define

* GET requests
* Server responses
* Developer console
* APIs (READ SOME DOCS)
* JSON (string formatted as a hash/object)

### Deliverables

* Write an application that takes a search term from a user
* Make a Request to the GoogleBooks API and get back some results
  * Always start with the docs! The API docs are your "single source of truth" about where that API data lives.
  * https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes?q=ruby+programming
* Display the titles, author names, and description for each book
